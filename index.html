    <h2>2021 HAcK by C's Get Degrees</h2>
  </div>

<p class="center">Three of the roughest toughest engineers in all of UCLA decided to take on the challenge of a liftime.
     They built not one, not two, but three different type of cars. One car ran through the power of bluetooth, one was controlled by joysticks and one has cutting edge AI to find its own way through a maze. </p>



     <p class="center , info-box">

    <h2 class="heading">Tier One</h2>
    

    <p>
      TIER 1
      The objective for tier 1 was to build a car using the parts given and be able to drive it via bluetooth through a python script. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Obstacles and Process of Solve Them
          <ul>
             <li>The main obstacle our team faced was figuring out the subassembly for the dismount platform. Our team spent the first day of HAcK, trying different ways to make the dismount subassembly.</li>
            <li>One of the team member plugged in a pin into "5V" instead of "VIN" which, although a tiny error, took a lot of time. Virtual collaboration issues delayed team's schedule.</li>
            <li>Mechanical issues with the parts we had came as one of the main big foes. One of the wheel had more friction to it than the other. So the car would slip at the end of a command, which in return caused a slight error in the position. Small errors add up to become huge ones. Our team spent a lot of time calibrating our code to overcome the downsides of the mechanical parts.</li>
            <li>Our team was skeptical about charging the lipo battery as we only had jumper wires to charge them. Some of the members accidentally shorted the battery as well. Our team ended up using the jumper wires to charge the battery at a low current level.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
          Easy Bits
          <ul>
            <li>Our team was able to chew through the coding for tier 1, even though we had to calibrate it later for the mechanical issues.</li>
            <li>Setting up the drivetrain for the car was finished by all members extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>We did not have any issues with the motor drive setup.</li>
            </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      After the completion of Tier 1, we had the full assembly of the car, where arduino, motor drive, and battery was setup.

    <h2 class="heading">Tier Two</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    
      TIER 2
      The objective of tier 2 was to drive the car using the joystick module, IR emitter, and IR receiver.
        Obstacles and Process to Solve Them
         - Mechanical issues remained despite team's effort to reassemble. Due to the time commitment, the team decided to calibrate our codes to account for mechanical issues.
         - The main problem during tier 2 was the IR receiver and emitter. These parts needed to be aligned in a certain manner so that the information sent by the emitter could be received by the receiver. 
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Obstacles and Process of Solve Them
        <ul>
          <li>When we started working on parts of teir 2 we still had not finished the dismount platform it however while working in teir two we tried enough itterations of designs to find one that worked.</li>
          <li>Like most things that require calibrating our IR receiver and emitter set up took some trial and error inorder to get it working.</li>
          <li>While working in teir two sparks flew and parts fried. One of our team members destroyed their servo here. If you ask them they still swear they have no clue how it happened.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
        Easy Bits
        <ul>
          <li>Our team was able to chew through the coding for tier 2, even though we had to calibrate it later for the mechanical issues.</li>
          <li>Most of the SolidWorks was completed durring this tier aswell.</li>

    <h2 class="heading">Tier Three</h2>
    
    <p>
      TIER 3
      The objective of tier 3 was to navigate an autonomous car through two mazes and have it auto dump its load. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Obstacles and Process to Solve Them
        <ul>
         <li>The initial logic for the autonomous, while we believed it would be simple at first we found it was a little more complicated to implement.
         <li>Calibration was a huge part of this tier. Time constraints did not allow for better calibration.</li>  
      </p>
        <p>
        Easy Bits
        <ul>
          <li>The code itself was not diffcult to write once we knew what we needed to do.</li>
      
          </ul>

  SOLIDWORKS
  </p>

  <p>
    Process
    <ul>
    <li>Our team utilized "GRABCAD" to download a list of pre-made parts.</li>
    <li>We designed any parts or assembled any subassembly that were not availabe in the list of pre-made parts and made drawings file or assembly files for them.</li>
		<li>Using the pre-made parts list along with our own parts and subassemblies, we assembled a replica of the car in Solidworks with proper mates that followed physics rules(i.e. no pasing).</li>
    <li>The next step was to perform FEA analysis on two of the parts : Platform and Mount. Mount has 3 configurations : with 2 ribs, with 1 rib, with no rib. We performed analysis on platform and each of the configurations and interpreted the results in our report.</li>
    <li>Our team then made drawing files for parts we previously missed.</li>
    <li>Finally, for the dump truck assembly, our team brainstormed design ideas and came up with some interesting additions to the previous version of the car. We utitlized self made assemblies and parts along with newly built subassemblies to build our final dump truck assembly.</li>
